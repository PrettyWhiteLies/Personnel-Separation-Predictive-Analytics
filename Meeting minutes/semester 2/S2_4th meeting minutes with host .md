# Meeting Minutes - September 13, 2024

**Date**: September 13, 2024  
**Time**: 09:35 - 10:32  
**Attendees**: Project Team Members, Dr. Vamsi K Madasu, Rick Doblanovic

## Overview
The meeting focused on discussing the upcoming project deadline, the synthetic data generation process, and the application of algorithms for employee turnover prediction. Key action items were assigned, and the team planned the next steps to ensure project completion on time.

## Key Discussion Points

### 1. Project Deadline and Work Schedule
- The final project submission is around **October 20th**, giving the team **one month** to complete the data generation and analysis tasks.

### 2. Data Generation and Variable Assignment
- The team discussed the strategy for data generation. 
- Each member was assigned specific variable categories, ensuring that logical consistency is maintained when generating synthetic data (e.g., executives having higher education, corresponding salary ranges, and work experience).

### 3. Synthetic Data Creation Process
- **100 data samples** will be generated for training and an additional **50 samples** for testing.
- Attrition rates of **8%-12%** will be randomly assigned to some employees to train the model on predicting employee turnover.

### 4. Algorithm Application and Analysis
- The team discussed applying **Random Forest** and its extended version (**Cox RF**) on the synthetic data.
- The final project will include a new **hybrid algorithm**, and the team was advised to reach out to the paper's authors for code to help with implementation.

### 5. Next Steps
- The team will generate data and begin testing algorithms while also working on the front-end development to present the project's complete workflow.
