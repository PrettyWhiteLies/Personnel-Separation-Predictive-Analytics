# Meeting Minutes - August 16, 2024

**Date**: August 16, 2024  
**Time**: 09:35 - 10:32  
**Attendees**: Project Team Members, Dr. Vamsi K Madasu, Rick Doblanovic

## Overview
The meeting focused on discussing the progress and plans related to the development and integration of data visualization tools, as well as the overall project strategy. Key points included the evaluation of different tools, the integration of databases, and the next steps in data collection and algorithm implementation.

## Key Discussion Points

### 1. Tool Evaluation and Selection
- **Metabase**: The team has explored Metabase as an option for data visualization and is leaning towards using it due to its open-source nature and flexibility. It allows the creation of dashboards and the integration of various data sources.
- **Tableau**: Also considered for its powerful visualization capabilities, though some concerns were raised regarding its cost and complexity.
- **Power BI**: While recognized for its robust features, the team decided against using Power BI due to the high costs associated with its premium features.

### 2. Database Integration
- The team successfully integrated CSV data into a PostgreSQL database and displayed the data using Metabase. Discussions focused on the potential to create user interfaces (UIs) for data entry and integration with backend algorithms for real-time data analysis.
- There was a discussion on the ability to modify and create new functionalities within Metabase, especially concerning data updates and real-time analytics.

### 3. Next Steps in Data Collection
- The team will focus on developing methods for data collection, including creating online questionnaires and input systems to populate the database with relevant data. This data will then be used to run predictive algorithms and generate actionable insights.
- The need for a standardized format for all collected data was emphasized to ensure consistency and ease of analysis.

### 4. Algorithm Implementation
- The discussion highlighted the need to implement and test various algorithms, starting with those used in the previous semester. The team was encouraged to develop a drop-down menu within the dashboard to allow users to select different algorithms and view their results.
- It was suggested that the team should start by integrating existing algorithms and then work towards developing custom solutions tailored to the projectâ€™s specific needs.

### 5. Future Planning
- A plan was established to provide the team with a list of metrics required for data collection, which will be shared in the following week. The team was tasked with exploring different tools and methods for effective data collection and analysis.

## Action Items
1. **Tool Finalization**: The team will finalize their choice between Metabase and Tableau, considering the feedback and further testing.
2. **Data Collection Strategy**: Develop and finalize a method for data collection, including designing questionnaires and establishing a standard data format.
3. **Algorithm Testing**: Integrate and test algorithms on the sample datasets, starting with previously used models and moving towards custom developments.
4. **Follow-up Meeting**: A follow-up meeting is scheduled for two weeks from today to review progress, discuss data collection tools, and finalize decisions on the tools and methods to be used.
