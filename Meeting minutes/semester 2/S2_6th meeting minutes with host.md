1. Meeting Overview:
- Date and Time: Friday, October 4, 2024, 09:32
- Duration: Approximately 1 hour 43 minutes
- Attendees: Rick Doblanovic, Vamsi Madasu, Pengjiabei Tang, Cheng (Chris) Qian, Junheng Yu, Yufeng Liu
- Purpose: Discuss project progress, including data creation, model analysis, dashboard demonstration, and preparation for upcoming presentation

2. Key Discussion Points:

a) Data Creation and Model Analysis:
   - Team has completed synthetic data creation and begun analysis
   - Random Forest and XGBoost models used, with accuracy around 96%
   - XGBoost model performed slightly better in predicting employee separation, with higher recall

b) Dashboard Demonstration:
   - Showcased dashboard functionalities, including prediction result display and feature analysis
   - Dashboard requires further refinement, especially in data input and result presentation

c) Model Comparison and Feature Importance:
   - Vamsi suggested comparing different models' performance to justify the chosen model
   - Emphasized the importance of identifying key variables influencing employee separation

d) Presentation Preparation:
   - Discussed content and format of the upcoming presentation
   - Stressed the need to include the entire project process, from data collection to analysis results

e) Dashboard Improvement Suggestions:
   - Rick suggested adding a tab focused on providing actionable recommendations
   - Emphasized designing the dashboard from the end-user perspective, making it user-friendly for non-technical personnel

f) Functionality Requirements Proposed by Vamsi:
   - Vamsi requested the ability to upload a new dataset containing 50 people
   - Dashboard should be able to read data from this file
   - System should provide prediction results for these 50 people, determining if they will leave
   - This functionality should be integrated into the dashboard, possibly as a separate page

g) Data Import Functionality:
   - Rick and Vamsi emphasized the importance of developing data import functionality
   - Suggested implementing the ability to import CSV or Excel files
   - Imported data should be quickly analyzed by the system and predictions made based on existing models

3. Decisions Made:
- Choose XGBoost as the final model for further parameter tuning and optimization
- Conduct a mock presentation (Friday, October 13) to receive feedback and make improvements
- Set the final presentation date for Tuesday, October 15 (afternoon), specific time to be determined

4. Action Items:
- Team: Prepare for the mock presentation on October 11
- Team: Improve dashboard, adding data import functionality and actionable recommendations
- Team: Compare different models' performance and provide analysis results
- Team: Identify and showcase key variables influencing employee separation
- Team (especially dashboard development members): Develop data import functionality allowing users to upload CSV or Excel files and make predictions based on this data
- Pengjiabei Tang: Arrange the final presentation for October 15 and invite relevant personnel
- Upload all functionality to GitHub and provide access to the host

5. Next Steps:
- Friday, October 11: Conduct mock presentation
- Tuesday, October 15 (afternoon): Deliver final presentation

6. Additional Notes:
- Project supervisors emphasized the importance of translating analysis results into actionable recommendations
- Suggested including a description of each team member's contributions in the presentation
- Team encouraged to seek help from Rick or Vamsi promptly when encountering issues
- Reminded team to avoid using "ADF" related terminology in the dashboard and presentation, instead using "personnel separation" or "employee separation"
