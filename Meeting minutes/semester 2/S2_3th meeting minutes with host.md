# Meeting Minutes - August 30, 2024

**Date**: August 30, 2024  
**Time**: 09:35 - 10:32  
**Attendees**: Project Team Members, Dr. Vamsi K Madasu, Rick Doblanovic

## Overview
This meeting focused on discussing the current status of the project related to employee retention analysis, particularly the generation and collection of data, the creation of synthetic data, and the survey design approach.

## Key Points Discussed

### 1. Synthetic Data Generation
- The team needs to generate synthetic data since the existing datasets do not fit the selected variables.
- Each member is tasked with generating 100 data points, leading to a total of 500 data points across 25 variables.
- The synthetic data will then be used to split into training and testing sets for analysis.
- Vandy emphasized the importance of ensuring the generated data is realistic and follows appropriate ranges for categories such as salaries and roles.

### 2. Survey Design and Data Collection
- The discussion highlighted the importance of aligning survey questions with the context of the employees who will fill them out.
- Surveys should include questions that are relevant to the employee's experience and that provide meaningful data for analysis.
- Privacy concerns were raised, and it was suggested that the survey should clearly communicate that responses are confidential.
- The survey should also motivate employees to complete it by explaining the benefits of their participation.

### 3. Improvement Suggestions
- The team discussed the need to improve the survey's design, including reordering questions, adding contextual explanations, and ensuring consistency in response formats.
- It was recommended to include fields that capture free-form text where necessary and to differentiate between data required for analysis and general survey questions.

### 4. Next Steps
- Vandy will clean up the spreadsheet, categorizing variables needed for data analysis separately from those required for the survey.
- An email will be sent out by Vandy with updates to the spreadsheet and guidance on how to generate the synthetic data.
- The team will reconvene on September 13, 2024, to review progress. If urgent issues arise, a meeting may be scheduled earlier.

## Action Items
- **All Team Members**: Begin generating the required 100 data points per person and review the updated spreadsheet.

## Next Meeting
- Scheduled for September 13, 2024, with potential for earlier meetings if necessary.

## Conclusion
The meeting emphasized the need for thoughtful survey design and realistic synthetic data generation. The team is expected to make significant progress on data collection and analysis preparation before the next meeting.
